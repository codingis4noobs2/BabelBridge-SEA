# Babel Bridge: Uniting Voices, Bridging Cultures

Welcome to Babel Bridge, where the rich tapestry of Southeast Asian (SEA) languages meets cutting-edge technology. Our mission is to foster understanding, cultural exchange, and the development of AI capabilities through the power of community contributions.

## Features

- **Speech to Text**: Convert your spoken words into data to help AI understand SEA languages.
- **Featured Contributor Spotlight**: Celebrate the achievements of our community's most active members.
- **Language Learning and Exchange**: Dive into SEA languages with basic phrases and immersive learning experiences.
- **Leaderboard Recognition**: Gain recognition and rewards for your contributions.
- **Rewarding Users Back**: Users get scores when their data is published, which can be converted to coins for purchasing items.

## What's Next

### Expanding Recognition: 
The platform aims to not only acknowledge the efforts of top contributors through internal recognition such as leaderboard rankings but also to extend this recognition beyond the digital realm. Plans include forming partnerships with educational institutions and governmental bodies that can offer tangible benefits to these contributors. This might involve:
- Scholarships and Courses: Top contributors could receive scholarships for language courses or cultural exchange programs, furthering their education and cultural understanding.
- Collaborations with Governmental Bodies: Recognized for their contributions to cultural and linguistic preservation, top contributors might have opportunities to collaborate on projects with governmental bodies focused on education, culture, and tourism.
- Public Acknowledgment: Achievements could be highlighted in public forums, websites, or events sponsored by educational and governmental partners, offering contributors public recognition for their efforts.

### Referral and Reward System
To grow the community and encourage active participation, a referral system is proposed where both the referrer and the referred users benefit from achieving certain milestones. This system could include:
- Bonus Points or Coins: Upon a referred friend's significant contribution or milestone achievement, both the referrer and the referred might receive bonus points or coins redeemable in the rewards store.
- Tiered Rewards: Different tiers of rewards based on the number of referrals or the contributions of referred users, encouraging ongoing engagement with the platform.
- Special Badges or Titles: Recognition within the platform with special badges or titles that display the user's success in growing the community.

### Cultural Ambassador Program: 
This program is designed to leverage the expertise and enthusiasm of standout contributors, turning them into leaders within the community. Cultural Ambassadors could:
- Organize and Lead Events: Use their knowledge and skills to organize language practice sessions, cultural workshops, or virtual meetups, fostering a stronger community.
- Create Cultural Content: Produce blogs, videos, or social media content that educates others about SEA cultures and languages, enhancing the platform's educational resources.
- Mentor New Learners: Offer guidance and support to newcomers, helping them navigate their language learning journey and integrate into the community.

### Virtual Language Cafés
To complement the asynchronous learning and contribution model, Virtual Language Cafés offer a synchronous, interactive element where users can practice languages in real-time. These virtual spaces feature:
- Themed Rooms: Each room could have a theme, such as travel, daily life, or food, encouraging users to practice relevant vocabulary and phrases.
- Moderated Conversations: To ensure a supportive and constructive environment, conversations could be moderated by experienced users or Cultural Ambassadors.
- Language Practice Games: Incorporate language learning games or activities that make practicing fun and engaging, catering to various proficiency levels.
- Scheduled Events: Regularly scheduled events within the cafés could include guest speakers, cultural presentations, or storytelling sessions, adding depth to the language learning experience.

## How to test:
- Create a new account or use the account(role: user) mentioned in app.py.
- Add any random data
- Logout
- Log in using the Contributor role Account
(username: contributor1, password: pass1)
(username: contributor2, password: pass2)
(username: contributor3, password: pass3)
- Click on the profile (username) and navigate to pending approvals and approve the data to be published(you can view the data and transcript both).
- You have to logout and do the same 2 more times with 2 other contributor accounts so that majority is achieved and it is finally published to the public data.
- Now if you go back to the account you made or used from app.py (role: user), you will see it has 2 points added to its account.
